# Value-Chain-Network

This is an ongoing personal project. The aim of this project to visualize global value chains and to model the entire global trade ecosystem. I am mainly using the networkD3 package on R.

The data used is derived from the Asian Development Bank Multi-Regional Input-Output Database. This database contains 60 economies and 35 sectors.

So far I have worked on the value chains for the Philippines in year 2011. I plan to add more countries and more years. In the future I plan to expand this as I refine my R coding skills.
